NOTE:  If using Rails 1.2.3 or below, and using SQL Server 2005, you MUST
install this patch: http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/7703

The ActiveWarehouse ETL Gem, version 0.8.1 or later, must be installed before
running the ActiveWarehouse tests.

You need two databases to run the unit tests:

* activewarehouse_unittest - used for the tests themselves
* activewarehouse_unittest_etl - required by activewarehouse-etl

You must create a test/database.yml file to configure the database connection
information used to store the ETL execution metadata. The configuration
must be named etl_execution, and it must map to the activewarehouse_unittest_etl
database.

You then need another configuration named awunit and point it to the
activewarehouse_unittest database.

See test/database.yml.example for an example configuration.

You can select the database connection to be used for the unit tests themselves
by using the DB= option when running rake. For example:

  rake DB=foo
  
This would require 'connection/foo/connection.rb' to establish the connection.

Note for creating new test tables, setup must follow this order:

 * Create the table
 * Require the model
 * Populate the table
 
This is necessary to avoid a "chicken and egg" problem as certain models require 
the table to exist.
