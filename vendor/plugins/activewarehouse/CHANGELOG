0.1.0 - Dec 19, 2006
* Initial release
 
0.2.0 - Feb 18, 2007
* Implemented basic hierarchical dimension functionality for variable depth 
  hierarchies
* Implemented dimensional views for dimensional role-playing
* Implemented support for type 2 slowly changing dimensions (courtesy of Seth 
  Ladd)
* Added generators for bridges and dimensional views to support the 
  functionality above
* Added unit tests for generators
* Significant performance improvements in how aggregate data is loaded into the
  cube
** Only get the calculated_fields and calculate_field_options once, outside of
   the aggregate loop.
** Condition added to the aggregate lookup query to only retrieve current stage
* Added :select to Dimension.available_values which makes it work on SQL Server
  (courtesy of Wenyi Zhou)
* Changed require_gem to gem and added alias to allow for older versions of
  rubygems
* Implemented initial random data generator with unit tests
* Added support for specifying a dimension-wide or level-by-level override of
  ordering. Useful for dates, for example when the month names should not be 
  ordered by name but should be ordered by the calendar order for the months
  
0.3.0 - May 13, 2007
* Updated docs.
* Fixed bug in report helper so that dimension ordering override now works as 
  expected.
* Changed dimension migration generator template to remove all the extraneous
  code.
* Complete overhaul of the Cube class implementation.
* Cube query results now encapsulated in the CubeQueryResult class.
* Cube query method now takes two forms, either the old style form with 4
  required arguments and 5 optional arguments (with the last argument an 
  options Hash) or the new style which takes a single Hash of options.
* Completely rewrote aggregation system. Cubes now delegate aggregation to
  Aggregation implementation classes.
* Developed NoAggregate aggregation strategy that goes directly to the fact
  and dimension tables.
* Refactored render_report helper.
* Refactored bridge class to allow for extension for specific bridge types
  (such as hierarchical bridges or weighted grouping bridges).
* Aggregate fields are now defined with classes. The base class is the Field
  class and it is implemented by AggregateField and CalculatedField.
* Added support for prejoining a fact with some or all of its dimensions
* Dimension to fact relationships are now defined with the dimension directive
  in the Fact class. This directive delegates to belongs_to.
* PosRetailSalesTransactionCube would now default to using 
  PosRetailSalesTransactionFact and all of its dimensions as its report_on and 
  pivots_on configuration by default. This means you only need to create a cube
  class and then can define report_on or pivots_on if you need to override 
  these defaults.
* Updated dimension view support, used for dimension role-playing.
* DateDimension is now implemented as a class extending from Dimension.
* Test cases modified to reflect ETL changes as well as new functionality.

0.4.0 -
* Applied patch from Giao Phan for date dimension builder.
* Updated for Rails 2.x, no longer compatible for Railsversions less than 2.x
